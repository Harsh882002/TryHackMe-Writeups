Summary
     This writeup follows an alternate, more detailed path through the Fowsniff room. 
     It explains why each step is taken, the commands used, and what to look for while doing enumeration, cracking, and exploitation.
     Wherever possible I include practical commands and short code snippets you can reuse.
